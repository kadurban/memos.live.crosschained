It can be "birth of a child" or a day when a favorite "football team wins a championship" or a day when "Bitcoin was launched" and so onâ€¦ NFTs created with memos.live are not just a single picture or video. Think about it like it is a package of various information and files associated with the event (date, time, pictures, videos, text). These packages of information are represented like Cards which users can interact with.
